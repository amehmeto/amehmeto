### Hi there üëã, I'm a React Js / React Native Developer

Are you looking for a React Js / React Native developer to join your team? Do you want to develop a website or a mobile application?

I am a frontend developer with 6 years of experience in the marketing, mobile video games, and sports sectors. I had the opportunity to work with a large group such as Decathlon, a scale-up such as Voodoo as well as for the startups folk.app, Heroes Jobs, and Germinal.

As a developer, I am committed to producing quality code, relying on Software Craftsmanship principles (TDD, Clean Code, Hexagonal Architecture, etc.), so that your users end up with the best possible application.

I am able to support you in:

‚úÖ Defining your needs.

‚úÖ Development and design of your website or mobile application.

‚úÖ Deployment on the web for your site or your application on the App Store.

‚úÖ Implementation of continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD).

Shall we discuss your project?
